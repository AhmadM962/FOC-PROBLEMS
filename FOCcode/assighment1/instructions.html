            <h1>Assignment 1: Output, Input, and Selection</h1>
            <h3>Due date: Friday, 24/November/2023 11:00 pm</h3>
            <h4>Late days (grace days) allowed: 1 day</h4>
            <p>In this assignment you will solve 6 problems that assess your skills in dealing with Ubuntu, Output, Input, and Selection in C.</p>
            <p>Each program will be written in a different file, but all programs will be submitted together in one compressed file called <code>handin.tar</code>.</p>
            <p>Read the following instructions completely before you 
start writing code to understand what the problems are, where to solve 
them, how to prepare your <code>handin.tar</code> submission file, and how to test it before submitting.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Download the lab materials from Autolab using the "Download handout" link and <b>extract</b> its content. You will get one directory called "assignment1-handout".</li>
                <li>Inside the assignment1-handout directory, you will find a few files. Check the next section to understand what each file does.</li>
                <li>You need to install a program called <code>make</code> to help you test your code and prepare your submissions.</li>
                    <p><b>You only have to install <code>make</code> once, so you will not need to do it again in the next assignments.</b></p>
                <p>To install <code>make</code> on Ubuntu, run the following command in the Ubuntu terminal and write your password when prompted to accept the installation:</p>
                <p><code>sudo apt install make</code></p>
                <p><small>Note for Mac users: If you are using Mac, you probably have <code>make</code> installed already. If not, you need to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/10265766/6463999" target="_blank">install the Mac Command Line Tools</a>.</small></p>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Assignment Files</h2>
            <p>Inside the extracted directory, you will find multiple C files, 1 file called <code>problem1.txt</code>, 3 files called <code>checker.sh</code>, <code>runguard.c</code>, and <code>Makefile</code>, and a directory called <code>tests</code>. You will need to modify some of these files, while some others should not be modified at all.</p>
            <h4>Files you need to modify:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Problem files:</li>
                <p><b>Each problem will have one file in this assignment.</b> Problem 1 will be solved in a text file called <code>problem1.txt</code> but other problems have C files called <code>problem2.c</code> for problem 2, and <code>problem3.c</code> for problem 3, and so on. The file of each problem will be used to solve <b>only that</b> problem.</p>
                <p>When you submit your assignment, all the problem 
files will be submitted, even if they are empty. Do not worry, you will 
only receive grades for the files that you implement, any unimplemented 
file will get 0 points until it is implemented and graded again. <b>Do NOT delete any of the problem files or change their names. If you do that, they will not be graded.</b></p>
                <p>To understand what you need to do in each problem, continue reading. Each problem is explained in the Problems section below.</p>
            </ul>
            <h4>Files you should NOT modify:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The <code>tests</code> directory and anything inside it:</li>
                <p>This directory contains a number of sample tests that
 will be used to test your code before you submit it. Each problem has 
its own directory inside <code>tests</code>, and inside each problem's directory there are two directories: <code>inputs</code> and <code>outputs</code>. The <code>inputs</code> directory contains the inputs of the test cases, and the <code>outputs</code>
 directory contains the expected outputs for the inputs. Do not move, 
remove, or modify these files. If you do that, you will not be able to 
test your solutions on your machine.</p>

                <li><code>checker.sh</code> and <code>runguard.c</code>:</li>
                <p>These two files will help you grade most of your work
 on your laptop without having to submit it to Autolab. You will not use
 these file by yourself, but you will be using a command that uses them,
 so do not worry about them. You do not need to open them or understand 
how they work.</p>

                <li><code>Makefile</code>:</li>
                <p>This file contains a few commands (called "make 
commands") that will make your life A LOT EASIER if you are using Ubuntu
 or Mac. If you followed the instructions in the Getting Started section
 above and installed <code>make</code>, you will be able to use a few commands to prepare your submission and test your code before you submit it to Autolab.</p>
                <p>To run any command, you just have to open the Ubuntu terminal (or the Mac terminal if you are on Mac) then <strong>cd into the assignment1-handout directory</strong> and type one of the following commands:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><code>make prepare-handin</code>: Takes all the problem files in the directory and compresses them together into one file called <code>handin.tar</code>. This will be the file you will submit to Autolab.</li>
                    <li><code>make test-handin</code>: Takes the <code>handin.tar</code> file that you generated from the <code>make prepare-handin</code>
 command, and extracts it into a new directory called 
assignment1-testgrade and and tests your solutions in it. It will 
display the result of grading in the terminal at the end. Here is an 
example of how it might look like:</li>
                    <pre>Cleaning up..
Compiling Problem 1..

                        </pre>
                    <p>Remember to always run <code>make prepare-handin</code> to create a new <code>handin.tar</code> file before running <code>make test-handin</code> to test your code.</p>
                    <li><code>make clean</code>: Deletes any extra files
 or directories that were created in the handout directory by the other 
commands (specifically, it deletes the handin.tar file and the 
assignment1-testgrade directory).</li>
                    </ol>
            </ul>

        <div>
            <h2>Submitting your Work</h2>
            <p>When you submit your code to Autolab, we test it using a 
combination of tests. First we apply the tests that were available to 
you by running the testing make command, and second by running another 
group of tests that are not available to you. This means that your code 
might get a full grade on your laptop but might get a lower grade on 
Autolab because it fails a few other tests. Only your grade on Autolab 
will be counted.</p>
            <p>To submit your work to Autolab:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a <code>handin.tar</code> file that contains your solutions as described in the section above.</li>
                <li>Upload <code>handin.tar</code> to Autolab in the assignment page.</li>
                <li>Accept the academic integrity compliance check.</li>
                <li>Click submit.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><b>Important note:</b> You can only make 7 total 
submissions for this assignment. Only your last submission will be 
counted toward your grade. The website displays the number of remaining 
submissions you have under the assignment submission page.</p>
            <p>Before submitting your work to Autolab, make sure that 
you test your code by running the testing make command, and by yourself 
(compile it with gcc and try it yourself) if you want to try other 
cases. You can test your work on your laptop as many times as you want 
before you submit it to Autolab. But you can only submit it 7 times to 
Autolab for this assignment.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Problem 1</h3>
                <p>Solve this problem inside the file <code>problem1.txt</code>.</p>
                <p>Suppose you opened Ubuntu, and you are in the home 
directory. Write the Ubuntu command required to do each of the following
 operations. Write each command on one line. Notice that the order of 
the commands you will write is important:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a new directory called Fall23</li>
                    <li>Go inside the Fall23 directory</li>
                    <li>Create a directory called FOC</li>
                    <li>Go inside the FOC directory</li>
                    <li>Create a new file called assignment0.txt, type 
anything in it and save it. (In your answer only add the command that 
creates the new file and opens it)</li>
                    <li>Copy assignment0.txt to a new file called assignment1.txt</li>
                    <li>Delete assignment0.txt</li>
                    <li>Finally, display the content of the file assignment1.txt on the terminal (Hint: Not gedit!)</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>This is not a C coding problem. Do not write C code. Just write the commands described above - one per line.</b></p>
                <p><b>Note:</b> This problem will be graded manually 
after the deadline. If you need feedback before the deadline, you can 
check with your instructor or TA.</p>

shown in the figure below.</p>
                <p class="center"><img src="instructions_files/uc.htm" width="10%"></p>
                <p>Write a program that accepts the height (ارتفاع) of 
the cone and the radius (نصف قطر) of the sphere (الشكل كروي) as inputs, 
then computes the volume (حجم) of the ice-cream using the two following 
formulas:</p>
