            <h1>Assignment 3: Bulding Functions and Using Arrays</h1>
            <h3>Due date: Monday, 15/January/2024 11:00 pm</h3>
            <h4>Allowed number of submissions on Autolab: 16 submissions</h4>
            <h4>Late days (grace days) allowed: 3 days</h4>
            <h4>Assignment Criteria: P7, P8 (Arrays and Multi-dimensional Arrays), M1, M2, M3, D2</h4>
            <h4>Assignment Make-up Criteria: P5, P6</h4>
            <p>In this assignment you will solve 9 problems that assess 
your skills in writing programs that implement Functions and use Arrays 
in C.</p>
            <p>Each program will be written in a different file, but all programs will be submitted together in one compressed file called <code>handin.tar</code>.</p>
            <p>Read the following instructions completely before you 
start writing code to understand what the problems are, where to solve 
them, how to prepare your <code>handin.tar</code> submission file, and how to test it before submitting.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Download the lab materials from Autolab using the "Download handout" link and <b>extract</b> its content. You will get one directory called "assignment3-handout".</li>
                <li>Inside the assignment3-handout directory, you will find a few files. Check the next section to understand what each file does.</li>
                <li>You need to install a program called <code>make</code> to help you test your code and prepare your submissions.</li>
                    <p><b>You only have to install <code>make</code> once, so you will not need to do it again in the next assignments.</b></p>
                <p>To install <code>make</code> on Ubuntu, run the following command in the Ubuntu terminal and write your password when prompted to accept the installation:</p>
                <p><code>sudo apt install make</code></p>
                <p><small>Note for Mac users: If you are using Mac, you probably have <code>make</code> installed already. If not, you need to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/10265766/6463999" target="_blank">install the Mac Command Line Tools</a>.</small></p>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Assignment Files</h2>
            <p>Inside the extracted directory, you will find multiple C files, 3 files called <code>checker.sh</code>, <code>runguard.c</code>, and <code>Makefile</code>, and a directory called <code>tests</code>. You will need to modify some of these files, while some others should not be modified at all.</p>
            <h4>Files you need to modify:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Problem files:</li>
                <p>Some problems will have one file, while others will 
have multiple files. The file or files of each problem will be used to 
solve <b>only that</b> problem.</p>
                <p>When you submit your assignment, all the problem 
files will be submitted, even if they are empty. Do not worry, you will 
only receive grades for the files that you implement, any unimplemented 
file will get 0 points until it is implemented and graded again. <b>Do NOT delete any of the problem files or change their names. If you do that, they will not be graded.</b></p>
                <p>To understand what you need to do in each problem, continue reading. Each problem is explained in the Problems section below.</p>
            </ul>
            <h4>Files you should NOT modify:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The <code>tests</code> directory and anything inside it:</li>
                <p>This directory contains a number of sample tests that
 will be used to test your code before you submit it. Each problem has 
its own directory inside <code>tests</code>, and inside each problem's directory there are two directories: <code>inputs</code> and <code>outputs</code>. The <code>inputs</code> directory contains the inputs of the test cases, and the <code>outputs</code>
 directory contains the expected outputs for the inputs. Do not move, 
remove, or modify these files. If you do that, you will not be able to 
test your solutions on your machine.</p>

                <li><code>checker.sh</code> and <code>runguard.c</code>:</li>
                <p>These two files will help you grade most of your work
 on your laptop without having to submit it to Autolab. You will not use
 these file by yourself, but you will be using a command that uses them,
 so do not worry about them. You do not need to open them or understand 
how they work.</p>

                <li><code>Makefile</code>:</li>
                <p>This file contains a few commands (called "make 
commands") that will make your life A LOT EASIER if you are using Ubuntu
 or Mac. If you followed the instructions in the Getting Started section
 above and installed <code>make</code>, you will be able to use a few commands to prepare your submission and test your code before you submit it to Autolab.</p>
                <p>To run any command, you just have to open the Ubuntu terminal (or the Mac terminal if you are on Mac) then <strong>cd into the assignment3-handout directory</strong> and type one of the following commands:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><code>make prepare-handin</code>: Takes all the problem files in the directory and compresses them together into one file called <code>handin.tar</code>. This will be the file you will submit to Autolab.</li>
                    <li><code>make test-handin</code>: Takes the <code>handin.tar</code> file that you generated from the <code>make prepare-handin</code>
 command, and extracts it into a new directory called 
assignment3-testgrade and and tests your solutions in it. It will 
display the result of grading in the terminal at the end. Here is an 
example of how it might look like:</li>
                    <pre>Cleaning up..

            <h2>Submitting your Work</h2>
            <p>When you submit your code to Autolab, we test it using a 
combination of tests. First we apply the tests that were available to 
you by running the testing make command, and second by running another 
group of tests that are not available to you. This means that your code 
might get a full grade on your laptop but might get a lower grade on 
Autolab because it fails a few other tests. Only your grade on Autolab 
will be counted.</p>
            <p>To submit your work to Autolab:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a <code>handin.tar</code> file that contains your solutions as described in the section above.</li>
                <li>Upload <code>handin.tar</code> to Autolab in the assignment page.</li>
                <li>Accept the academic integrity compliance check.</li>
                <li>Click submit.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><b>Important note:</b> You can only make 16 total 
submissions for this assignment. Only your last submission will be 
counted toward your grade. The website displays the number of remaining 
submissions you have under the assignment submission page.</p>
            <p>Before submitting your work to Autolab, make sure that 
you test your code by running the testing make command, and by yourself 
(compile it with gcc and try it yourself) if you want to try other 
cases. You can test your work on your laptop as many times as you want 
before you submit it to Autolab. But you can only submit it 16 times to 
Autolab for this assignment.</p>

                <p>In this problem you will write a program that sorts 
(orders) a group of integers descendingly (from larger to smaller) then 
displays the integers in order in addition to the number of pairs of

                <p>The following pseudo-code describes the algorithm you
 will use, if you follow it and implement it correctly, you should be 
able to solve this problem.</p>
<pre>- store the number of integers in a variable $count$
- define an array of size $count$
- store the integers in the array
- define a variable to store the number of swaps and initialize it to 0
- define a variable $i$ and set its value to the first index of the array
- repeat the following as long as $i$ is less than the size of the array:
  - find the maximum element between the elements that start at index $i$ and end at the last index in the array
  - if the index of the maximum element is not equal to $i$:
    - swap the maximum element with the element at index $i$
    - increment the number of swaps (add 1 to it)
  - increment $i$
- print the number of swaps as in the examples below
- print the integers of the array on a new line, separate each two integers by a space

with 50, the array becomes 60 50 20 40 30. Then 20 is swapped with 40, 
the array becomes 60 50 40 20 30. Then 20 is swapped with 30, the array

                <h3>Problem 2</h3>
                <p>Solve this problem inside the file <code>problem2.c</code>. <strong>Do not modify any other files for this problem.</strong></p>

                <p>In this problem, you will learn a smart way to deal 
with data in programs. You will create what is called a Frequency Array 
to quickly find the number of times an integer appears in an array.</p>
                <p>Before we learn how to do that, think if you had an array of <code>n</code>
 integers and you were asked to find the number of times the number 6 
appears in it, you can simply create a loop that counts the number of 
times an element is equal to 6. For example, assuming we have an array <code>elements</code> that has 10 integers:</p>
<pre>int count = 0;
for (int i = 1; i &lt; 10; ++i) {
    if (elements[i] == 6)
        ++count;
}
printf("The number 6 appears %d times in the array.\n", count);
</pre>
            <p>Now if you were asked to repeat the same thing but for a 
different number, you will have to create another loop, or you can ask 
the user how many numbers they wish to check then put the previous loop 
inside another loop and ask the user for a number to check each time:</p>
<pre>printf("How many numbers do you want to check?\n");
int numbers;
scanf("%d", &amp;numbers);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; numbers; ++i) {
    printf("Please enter a number:\n");
    int number;
    scanf("%d", &amp;number);
    
    int count = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j &lt; 10; ++j) {
        if (elements[j] == number)
            ++count;
    }
    printf("The number %d appears %d times in the array.\n", number, count);
}
</pre>
                <p>The method above works, but it is slow because each 
time we will need to go over the whole array to count the number of 
occurences of the number. A better method to do this is using what is 
called a Frequency Array.</p>
                <p>A frequency array is an array that stores the number 
of times an element appears in another array under an index equal to 
that number. The following steps and examples will help you understand 
and build a frequency array:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first step is to know what is the maximum 
number the array can have. We will use this number to create a new 
array. For example, if you were trying to count grades for students, you
 know that the maximum grade is 100 so you will use 100 in the next 
step. In the example in the image below, we will assume that 15 is the 
maximum number that could be in the array.</li>
                    <li>We create a new array that has a size equal to the number from the previous step + 1</li>
                    <li>We set all the elements of the new array to zero</li>
                    <p class="center"><img src="instructions_files/frequency-array-initial.jpg" width="70%"></p>
                    <li>Go over all the elements in the original array:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We add 1 to the index of the frequency array
 that is equal to the element in the current index of the original 
array. For example, if the current element in the original array is 5, 
we add 1 to index 5 in the frequency array.</li>
                        <li>This trick allows us to use the indices in 
the frequency array as the actual numbers, and the values in those 
indices as the frequencies (or number of occurences or appearances).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Once we are done, our frequency array will be 
ready. Each index will have in it the number of times it appeared in the
 original array.</li>
                    <p class="center"><img src="instructions_files/frequency-array-filled.jpg" width="70%"></p>
                    <li>Now we can simply find the frequency of any 
number from the original array by going to the index equal to that 
number in the frequency array. For example, to find the frequency of the
 number 6 in the original array, we go to the index 6 in the frequency 
array and find that the answer is 3.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Now it is your turn:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Write a program that accepts an integer <code>n</code> that corresponds to the number of integers in an array. Then accept <code>n</code> numbers that correspond to the array elements. The maximum element in the array will be equal to 1300.</li>
                    <li>You will then need to build the frequency array just like we learned above.</li>
                    <li>After that, your program will accept another integer <code>q</code> that corresponds to the number of integers we need to check the frequency for. The input will then have <code>q</code> integers, print the frequency for each one of them on a new line.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <table border="1">
                    <tbody><tr>
                        <th>Input</th>
                        <th>Output</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>10<br>8 7 6 7 6 9 6 5 4 5<br>5<br>6 7 5 6 8</td>
                        <td>3<br>2<br>2<br>3<br>1</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody></table>
                <p>Explanation: The example above is the same one we 
have in the figures above. The number 6 appeared 3 times in the original
 array. The numbers 7 and 5 appeared twice. The number 6 again appeared 3
 times, and finally 8 appeared once.</p>

                <p>Solve this problem inside the file <code>problem3.c</code>. <strong>Do not modify any other files for this problem.</strong></p>

                <p>Your friend got a new job in a shoe factory. He works
 as a quality assurance officer and is responsible for confirming the 
quality and numbers of a special shoe called "Cshu". Each day, the 
factory produces pairs of shoes of different sizes, for example: a pair 
of size 33 and a pair of size 35. Each pair has 2 shoes (left and 
right).</p>
                <p>Your friend noticed that the number of shoes that was
 produced one day was not even. He reviewed the machines that produce 
the shoes and discovered an issue in one of them that makes them produce
 1 shoe instead of 2. Luckily this only happens one time each day, so 
only one shoe size will have 1 shoe, but all the other shoe sizes will 
have 2. He brought a list of the shoe sizes that were produced on that 
day and asked for your help in writing a program that can find the size 
of the shoe that appears only once in the list in case the issue happens
 again.</p>
                <p>Your program must accept an integer <code>n</code> (<code>n</code> will always be odd) that represents the number of shoe sizes in the list. Your program will then accept <code>n</code>
 integers, each integer represents a shoe size. Each integer will appear
 exactly twice, except for one integer that will appear once. You need 
to find it.</p>

                <h3>Problem 4</h3>
                <p>Solve this problem inside the files <code>problem4-library.h</code> and <code>problem4-library.c</code>. <strong>Do not modify any other files for this problem.</strong></p>

                <p>In geometry (علم الهندسة الرياضية), a line on the 2D 
Cartesian system (مستوى الديكارتي ثنائي الأبعاد) can be represented 
using two values that describe its length and direction, and it is 
called a Vector.</p>
                <p>The following figure shows two vectors, the first vector is <code>v = [2, 1]</code>, and the second vector is <code>w = [1, 1]</code>.
 The first number in the vector description describes how far on the 
x-axis it goes, and the second number describes how far it goes on the 
y-axis.</p>
                <p class="center"><img src="instructions_files/vectors.png" width="40%"></p>
                <p>If the system was in 3D, the vector will have a third number that describes how far it goes on the z-axis, for example <code>u = [3, 2, 4]</code>. This idea can be generalized to any number of dimensions.</p>
                <p>The angle between the 2 vectors is needed in many 
applications such as in physics, aviation, machine learning, and many 
many more. Your task in this problem is to find the angle between two 
vectors that have n-dimensions, using the following steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each vector will be represented using a 1D array. Vector <code>v</code> will have <code>n</code> elements <code>[v<sub>0</sub>, v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, ..., v<sub>n - 1</sub>]</code>, and vector <code>w</code> will have <code>n</code> elements <code>[w<sub>0</sub>, w<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>, ..., w<sub>n - 1</sub>]</code>.</li>
                    <li>The cosine of the angle between the two vectors 
(let us call the angle θ - pronounced theta) can be computed using the 
following formula:</li>
                    <p class="center"><img src="instructions_files/cosine-equation.png" width="30%"></p>
                    <li>The dot product of two vectors is simply the sum
 of the product of elements that have the same indices, it can be 
computed using the following formula:</li>
                    <p class="center"><img src="instructions_files/dot-product.png" width="40%"></p>
                    <li>The magnitude of a vector is its length, it can be computed using the following formula:</li>
                    <p class="center"><img src="instructions_files/magnitude.png" width="40%"></p>
                </ul>
                <p>You need to write the 4 following functions inside <code>problem4-library.c</code>, then add their prototypes to <code>problem4-library.h</code>:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>readArray</strong>: accepts an integer 
that represents the size of an array, and the array. Asks the user to 
input the elements of the array and stores them in the array. Returns 
nothing.</li>
                    <li><strong>dotProduct</strong>: accepts an integer 
that represents the size of an array, and two arrays of that size. 
Returns the dot product of the two arrays using the equation above.</li>
                    <li><strong>magnitude</strong>: accepts an integer 
that represents the size of an array, and the array. Returns the 
magnitude of the passed array using the equation above.</li>
                    <li><strong>radiansToDegrees</strong>: accepts an 
angle in radians, and returns its corresponding value in degrees. 
radians = degrees x π / 180.0, where π = 3.141592.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Hint: Look at the main function in <code>problem4.c</code>
 but do not modify it. It will help you understand the types each 
function accepts and returns. The main function prints some things on 
the screen, do not print them again in your functions.</p>

                <p>Solve this problem inside the file <code>problem8-library.c</code>. <strong>Do not modify any other files for this problem.</strong></p>
                <p>A polynomial is a simple equation that when given the x value of a point, gives a y value for that point.</p>
                <p>For example: <code>y = x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 1</code> 
is a polynomial. If we want to find the y value of a point that has the 
value x = 2, we plug it into the polynomial and find that y = 4 + 4 + 1 =
 9, so the point will be (2, 9).</p>
                <p>If you do not know the polynomial equation but have a
 group of points (x, y) generated from that polynomial, you can use them
 to approximate a new point by finding the y value for any new x. You 
will write 3 functions to do that as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open the file <code>problem8-library.h</code> and look at the 3 function prototypes we defined for you: <strong>findTerm</strong>, <strong>findAllPointTerms</strong>, and <strong>findY</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Read the description of the function <strong>findTerm</strong> then implement it inside <code>problem8-library.c</code>.</li>
                    <li>Read the description of the function <strong>findAllPointTerms</strong> then implement it inside <code>problem8-library.c</code>.</li>
                    <li>Read the description of the function <strong>findY</strong> then implement it inside <code>problem8-library.c</code>.</li>
                    <li>The code inside <code>problem8.c</code> is 
already written for you. It will ask the user to enter the x and y 
values for a group of points, then use your functions to approximate the
 value of y for a number of new points. You can read it if you want to 
understand the input.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The functions you will write implement the following equations to approximate the value. <span class="underline"><strong>It is okay if you do not understand them, you do not have to understand them to solve this problem</strong></span>. We have explained everything you need to do in <code>problem8-library.h</code> before each function. The equations below are just provided for more context.</p>

                <h4>Notes</h4>
                <p>In the first example, we have 4 known points, and we use them to approximate the value of one new point with x = 2.<br>The points in the first example are actually generated from the same polynomial we mentioned above <code>y = x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 1</code>. Notice how the code correctly approximated the value of y for x = 2 to be 9.</p>
                <p>In the second example we have 5 points, and we use them to approximate the values of 2 new points with x = 2 and x = 5.</p>

                <p>Solve this problem inside the file <code>problem9.c</code>. <strong>Do not modify any other files for this problem.</strong></p>
                <p>You are given a 2D array that has <code>n</code> rows and <code>m</code> columns, find the sum of its elements using the following instructions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start with the first column</li>
                    <li>Go over the elements of the first column from top to bottom</li>
                    <li>Add each element to the sum</li>
                    <li>Before moving to a new row, multiply the sum so far by 10</li>
                    <li>Once you finish the first column, divide the sum by 10, then go to the first element of the second column</li>
                    <li>Repeat the above for all the columns</li>
                    <li>Print the resulting sum</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The input starts with <code>n</code>, and <code>m</code>. Then follows <code>n</code> lines, each line has <code>m</code> integers that represent the 2D array.</p>

                    </tr>
                </tbody></table>
                <p>In the second example, following the instructions: 
After we add the first 2 to the sum, we multiply by 10 to get 20, then 
we add 3 to get 23. We finished a column so we divide by 10 to get 2. 
Then we start with the new column, we multiply by 10 to get 20, we add 7
 to get 27, we multiply by 10 to get 270, we add 4 to get 274, we 
finally divide by 10 because we finished a column so we get 27.</p>
